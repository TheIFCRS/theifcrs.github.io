# Welcome

The International Fossil Coral and Reef Society (IFCRS) was founded in the early 1970s under the name 'The International Association for the Study of Fossil Cnidaria and Sponges'. The Society's mission is to promote and disseminate research on fossil corals, sponges, and reefs in the broadest sense. 

The Society's flagship event is an international symposium held every four years. We also host an annual online Early-Career Researcher symposium and periodic lecture series.

The IFCRS is an all volunteer society and has no membership fees (it is free to join!). The Society has a long history of being a welcoming, supportive, and friendly organisation. Many of our members have made lifelong friends and colleagues through the Society.
