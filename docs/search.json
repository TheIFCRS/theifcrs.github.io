    "text": "Dear members of IFCRS, colleagues and friends,\nWe are happy to arrive at the end of yet another successful year for our society. The most remarkable event was that after four long years - and overcoming a pandemic- we could finally meet in person at the European Centre for Geological Education (Chęciny, Poland) to enjoy the interesting scientific programme of our 14th IFCRS meeting, besides “going deeper” into a rich cultural and geological agenda at many other places around Poland. In the general assembly, we collectively elected new council members Kun Liang, Thomas Stemmann and Danijela Dimitrijevic, while giving continuity to Markus Aretz, Lewis Jones, Angelina Ivkic, Julien Denayer, Jarek Stolarski and Nadia Santodomingo. We sincerely acknowledge our leaving council members Francesca Bosellini, Wolfgang Kiessling, Nancy Budd, Graham Young and Christina Krause for their hard work on bringing up our society with new branding, social media presence and a suite of novel activities over the past few years. We also awarded our colleague Brian Rosen with the Milne Edwards Medal for his important scientific contributions to our field. We voted that our next 15th IFCRS meeting would be in Toulouse (France) in 2027 thanks to the kind offer presented by Markus Aretz. As announced, publication of the proceedings of the 14th IFCRS conference is planned in international peer reviewed journal Acta Palaeontologica Polonica (https://www.app.pan.pl/). Detailed guidelines will be announced soon.\nDuring 2023 we marked the second year of the successful online IFCRS Lectures Series. The winter/spring lectures were presented by Jarek Stolarski, Francesca Bosellini, Andrea Quattrini, Paolo Montagna, and Stephen Kershaw, to give a great closure in the Autumn with Mikołaj Zapalski. The calendar for 2024 will be advertised early next year. We appreciate the loyal attendance of our colleagues all over the world who actively engage in fruitful discussions, as well as we thank our lecturers for generously sharing their expertise. Thanks to the diligent work of Lewis Jones, we are pleased to launch the new Society’s website https://ifcrs.org/. We will continue sharing news and activities there and through our social media accounts on Twitter (now X) “@fossil_reef” and Instagram “fossil_reef”. We encourage you to follow us on those channels and contribute with content, photos, and news by tagging our handles or sending us an email to fossilcoralreef@gmail.com.\nWhile we wait to see each other again in four years, we are happy to announce that the Third IFCRS Early Career Researcher Symposium, will be led by our Chengdu and Nanjing ECR colleagues. We expect that these yearly ECR meetings will keep offering a stage for our enthusiastic young members to present their exciting novel research. Equally, we would like to extend the invitation to the symposium “Reef paleoecology in time and space” organised by our colleagues Aaron O’Dea, Rowan Martindale and Katie Cramer as part of the 12th North American Paleontological Convention (NAPC) at the University of Michigan (June 17-21, 2024). We hope to see many of you attending our activities for the next year. On behalf of the Council, we wish a happy New Year 2024 to you and your loved ones."

    "text": "Read as PDF\n\n\n\nTom holding a fossil coral at the 14th IFCRS fieldwork in Poland, September 2023. Photo by J. Stolarski.\n\n\nI am tremendously saddened by the sudden and untimely passing of Tom Stemann. My recollections of Tom are during the late 1980’s and the 1990’s before his eventual faculty appointment at the University of the West Indies at Mona, Jamaica. He was a graduate student at the University of Iowa under my direction and received his PhD from Iowa in 1991. His dissertation was entitled “Evolution of the reef-coral family Agariciidae (Anthozoa: Scleractinia) in the Neogene through Recent of the Caribbean”, and it focused on the Mio-Pliocene of the Dominican Republic. Tom was a very bright student who loved fieldwork collecting fossil and living corals. As a graduate student, he was my field assistant in both the Dominican Republic and Panama. He also travelled by himself to the Dominican Republic for a month to collect agariciid fossils for his dissertation and rented a scooter to travel around. Quite an adventurous spirit! He was a quiet and creative person with a quick wit, always making us laugh, and he was open-minded and easygoing, never complaining or stressed out. I will always remember him counting his bug bites when we returned from the field each day. One day it was something like 72 bug bites. One day in the Mao Formation we had a flat tire (thorns on the road) followed by three more flat tires on the road to Puerto Plata (nails on the road). Tom and Ken Johnson quickly changed the first flat tire but had to arrange for a tire center (Centro de Gomas) to meet us and repair the three other tires. No problem – time to relax and savour a Presidente in between outcrops. Tom had a keen eye for morphology, and his dissertation tackled one of the most taxonomically challenging groups of scleractinian corals – the agariciids (six genera, 18 species). He distinguished species morphometrically by making comparisons with modern species. In fact, he was one of the first fossil coral workers to use phylogenetic analyses to examine their relationships.\n\n\n\nTom quantifying fossil staghorn corals, Acropora, in the Dominican Republic (1989). Photo by K. Johnson.\n\n\nAfter he obtained his Ph.D., Tom had a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Bern in Switzerland under the supervision of Jörn Geister. At that time, he became interested in the Paleogene of Italy and collaborated with Francesca Bosellini on Actinacis rollei. Tom also worked with me on a large collection of Eocene corals made by Robert Stewart (geologist of the Panama Canal Commission) in the Gatuncillo Formation of Panama and described five new species. On his return to Iowa from Europe, Tom joined our group examining Plio-Pleistocene turnover in Caribbean reef coral fauna. Not knowing that Jamaica would eventually become his home, Tom toured Jamaica for the first time with us in 1994 making large Plio-Pleistocene coral collections and helping with identifications. Of course, later on, upon moving to the island, he became an expert in its geology and paleontology.\n\n\n\nTom walking along an outcrop at Enriquillo Valley in the Dominican Republic (1989). Photo by K. Johnson.\n\n\nTom really enjoyed the more carefree, slow-paced lifestyle of the Caribbean, and I’m so glad he had a faculty position at the University of the West Indies. Tom was also dedicated to the IFCRS, attending most of the meetings of the society and appreciating its international orientation. He was especially honored to serve on the IFCRS council.\nNancy Budd, Emeritus Professor University of Iowa, Nov. 2024.\n\n\n\nEnjoying fieldwork at an Oxfordian outcrop of Saint Mihiel, France (1991).

Corals are not “simple animals” and that’s why I love them!\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkus Aretz (Toulouse, France), Vice President\nI am a professor at the University of Toulouse (France), where I teach palaeontology, carbonate sedimentology and field geology. My research interests cover different aspects of the evolution of the geosphere and biosphere, with a focus on the upper Palaeozoic. This results in broad interests in fields like carbonate sedimentology, coral taxonomy, palaeobiology, palaeo(bio)geography, palaeodiversity, stratigraphy, and basin analysis. One of my long-time favourites are reef systems. In 2027, the next IFCRS symposium will be held in Toulouse. We are already excited to host our community in the Ville rose!\n\n\n\n\n\nNadia Santodomingo (London, England), Secretary\nI am a coral-reef scientist interested in the diversity, ecology and evolution of these highly diverse ecosystems. My main focus has been to improve our understanding of the origins and evolution of coral reefs on Earth. My investigations cover a broad spatial scale, with studies in the Caribbean and the Indo-Pacific (Coral Triangle) from shallow to deep-water habitats. My research involves also a broad temporal scale, as I develop multidisciplinary studies that link the history of ancient and modern reefs by using cutting-edge biogeographic, molecular and phylogenetic tools. By integrating fossils and modern coral taxa, I expect to obtain key information to predict how reefs are likely to respond to the current scenario of rapid climate change, and ultimately, to offer reliable advice to conservation agencies to protect these important ecosystems.\n\n\n\n\n\nLewis Jones (London, UK), Internet Officer\nI am a Palaeobiologist at University College London, UK. My research focuses on understanding the drivers of temporal and spatial biodiversity patterns across various timescales. Primarily, my work focuses on scleractinian corals, reef systems, and other marine invertebrates. In my research, I use a range of computational techniques and integrate tools from various disciplines, including ecology and palaeoclimatology. I am currently investigating the drivers of marine biodiversity hotspots throughout the Cenozoic and reconstructing their evolutionary history.\n\n\n\n\n\nDanijela Dimitrijevic (Erlangen, Germany), Early Career Researcher representative\nI am PhD candidate at FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg in Germany. I am interested in how reef communities, corals and their traits responded to global environmental disturbances such as mass extinctions and hyperthermal events on geological time scales to help predict the future of modern reefs. To answer these questions, I use large databases such as the Paleobiology Database (PBDB), PaleoReefs Database (PARED), Ancient Reef Traits Database (ART), and R programming environment.\n\n\n\n\n\nKun Liang (Nanjing, China), Elected council member\nI am an associate professor in Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. I am fascinated for the palaeoecology and evolution of Palaeozoic corals and stromatoporoids, as well as reef-related organisms. My research has involved morphometrics to distinguish species and serial sectioning techniques to study the budding pattern and phylogeny of ancient corals. My recent topic concerns with integrative stratigraphy and evolution of Palaeozoic reefs in Tibet and adjacent regions.\n\n\n\n\n\nAngelina Ivkić (Vienna, Austria), Elected council member\nI am currently pursuing my PhD at the University of Vienna, focusing on the study of fossil corals from the last interglacial period. My research interest lies in using past periods characterized by higher temperatures to forecast potential trajectories for the future of coral reefs in the Red Sea. Moreover, I am passionate about science communication and involved in a project aimed at creating an engaging detective game centered around coral reefs for educational purposes. Within IFCRS, my primary responsibilities involve managing social media platforms.\n\n\n\n\n\nThomas Stemann (Mona, Jamaica), Elected council member\nI am a Lecturer in the Department of Geography and Geology at the University of the West Indies in Kingston Jamaica. My research chiefly focusses on patterns in Caribbean reef coral diversity and paleoecology from the Cretaceous through the Recent. This work has involved field work throughout the Caribbean and Central America and centred over the last 25 years on the rich fossil record in Jamaica.\n\n\n\n\n\nJulien Denayer (Liège, Belgium), Elected council member\nMy main research focuses on Devonian and Carboniferous rugose corals, their evolution, palaeoecology, stratigraphy and palaeobiogeography. Moreover, I study their response to biotic crises, extinctions and recoveries, particularly in the Late Devonian. Working on corals also led me to be interested in the reefal environment and the development of reefs during the Devonian with a peculiar view on southern Belgium where Devonian reefs are so common and so beautiful. I also have a profound passion for regional and historical geology that provide a good context for the corals I study.",

    "title": "Obituary: Jörn Geister",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Jörn GEISTER (Fig. 1) was born on October 29, 1940, in Würbenthal, in the Eastern Sudetes, amidst the turmoil of World War II. The territory, now part of the Czech Republic, had been annexed by the Third Reich two years before his birth. In 1946, he was forced to migrate to Germany with his mother and grandparents. His father had already perished in Berlin with the arrival of the Russian Red Army. He vividly remembered the long journey in a windowless cattle train. After several relocations within Germany—Bavaria, Westphalia, and the Black Forest—where he attended primary school, his family finally settled in Württemberg. In 1960, he completed his Abitur at Wagenburg-Gymnasium in Stuttgart, specializing in mathematics and natural sciences. From 1960 to 1967, he studied geology and paleontology at the University of Stuttgart. During his studies, he spent eight months conducting fieldwork on Jurassic stratigraphy in Spain (Province of Valencia).\nHis studies were crowned by a Diplomarbeit guided by O. F. Geyer, devoted to the Jurassic stratigraphy of the region of Tabernes de Valldigna (Spain, Valencia Province).\n\n\n\nFig. 1: Jörn Geister in Bern 2019\n\n\nFrom 1968 to 1970, he obtained financial support for a research stage from the Biology department of the University of Cartagena (Colombia) and then from the Instituto Colombo-Alemán de Investigaciones Cientificas Santa Marta (Colombia) to put a first foot in the ecology of Recent reefs and the systematics of the West Indian coral fauna. This work was crowned in August 1973 by a doctoral thesis defended in Stuttgart, guided by O.F. Geyer, and entitled: “Riffbau und geologische Entwicklungsgeschichte der Insel San Andres (westliches Karibisches Meer, Kolumbien)” [Reef construction and geological development history of the island of San Andres (western Caribbean Sea, Colombia)].\nThe Colombian islands of San Andres and Providencia will stay in his heart forever. Then he obtained a position at the Geological Institute of the University in Bern in which he will get the status of Assistent, then Oberassistent, Oberassistent-Lektor, and Privatdozent. For many years numerous students were trained by him in macropalaeontology, in lectures and practical courses. From 1974 to 1980 he followed his research on Quaternary Caribbean reefs (Fig. 2) and defended a habilitation in Bern to obtain the Venia Docendi in 1982.\n\n\n\nFig. 2: The famous Geister’s zonation of Caribbean reefs in its english version (Geister 2011, Jörn published many versions of this model in various languages).\n\n\nSoon after his habilitation, he organised with René Herb a course in French Géologie et paléoécologie des récifs for the universities of western Switzerland, which is a nice summary of the topic at that time. Since 1992, he had to teach alone micropalaeontology, stratigraphy and historical geology in Bern. But his position was also an opportunity to guide field excursions—he loved that—in Recent and Pleistocene reefs of the Red Sea (Sinai Peninsula) and organize seminars on Holocene and Pleistocene reefs, on sclerochronology, actuopalaeontology, or applied ecology of Recent reefs (among others).\nIn March 1986 he organized the Symposium “Meeresforschung in der Schweiz [Marine research in Switzerland]” in Bern, with more than 200 participants.\nHe also took responsibility for various “Diplomarbeiten” on palaeontology in the Jura mountains, Recent reefs or sclerochronology but also the guidance of PhD theses in the frame of a project on Mauritius Island. Thomas Wagner (1994) defended a thesis on: Grundlagen der Sklerochronologie von Riffkorallen und ihre Eignung zur Erfassung von Umwelteinflüssen im Riffökosystem von Mauritius (Indischer Ozean) [Basics of sclerochronology of reef corals and their suitability for recording environmental influences in the reef ecosystem of Mauritius (Indian Ocean)] and Ina Immenhauser-Potthast, (1994) on: Geochemie von rezenten, massigen Korallen und umweltgeologische Untersuchungen im Riffökosystem der Insel Mauritius (Indischer Ozean). [Geochemistry of Recent, massive corals and environmental geological studies in the reef ecosystem of Mauritius Island (Indian Ocean)].\nI met Jörn for the first time in 1989 in the Quarry of Malancourt-la-Montagne in Lorraine. We were surrounded by Bajocian reefs and he proposed to collaborate and organise a field excursion on the Jurassic reefs of Lorraine for the Münster (1991) congress of the Fossil Cnidaria and Porifera Association. He already had good experience preparing such events. He had previously prepared the spring excursion of the Swiss Paleontological Society for which he was president (1987-88), it was a three-day excursion near Marseille with J Philip. He had also prepared logistically more difficult events such as the Rio Gurabo Neogene stratigraphy excursion for the 9th Caribbean Geological Conference (Sto. Domingo 1980) with P. Jung und J. Saunders and the Pleistocene Reef Terraces and Coral Environments at Sto. Domingo and near Boca Chica, southern coast of the Dominican Republic, for the same congress.\nThen I saw how an excursion had to be prepared. Jörn noted every detail in his notebook, the quality of the food, the price of everything and even the hour of the sunset. Then our excursion happened and we decided to make it again for the pre-congress excursion of the Luxembourg Symposium that we organised together in 1994. Jörn had prepared also a wonderful post-congress snorkelling trip in the Sinai Peninsula. I remember him swimming like a fish, going down at ten meters deep so easily with a shirt and corduroy pants to protect his very white skin. After these events, we decided to build a research project on the climatic conditions of the Jurassic Oxfordian reef event. Together we recruited Bertrand Martin-Garin for a pH D thesis and this was a source of multiple collaborations and field works in France, Switzerland, Morocco, and Crimea (Fig. 3-4) that produced results for a decade beyond the date of his retirement in 2006.\n\n\n\nFig. 3: Jörn Geister in 2005 in Crimea in Simferopol.\n\n\n\n\n\nFig. 4: Jörn Geister in 2005 writing his notes in the field on an Oxfordian reef at Sudak.\n\n\n\n\n\nFig. 5: Field in Morroco in 2003. From left to right: Bertrand Martin Garin, Jörn Geister and B. Lathuilière\n\n\nAfter that date, he became a free collaborator of the Natural History Museum in Bern. In the same decade of activity, he never abandoned the work done on Recent Colombian reefs in collaboration with J.M. Diaz. His fidelity to his Colombian fieldwork allowed him to produce comparable underwater photos of the same reefal place at a 30-year distance (see his 2012 publication). Jörn has never chosen between Recent and Ancient. It was a real strength of his approach, always searching for a comparable scenario in Recent to explain observations of the past. After retiring, he continued working regularly at the Museum in Bern, where he developed a close relationship with Ursula Menkveld, Curator of paleontology, and Bernhard Hostettler, first working as a student as geoscientific preparator and later with the Master and PhD title as a scientific collaborator. Acting as an unofficial advisor, he assisted the latter in defending a Master’s thesis in 2006 on Oxfordian sea urchins (Die fossilen regulären Echiniden der Günsberg-Formation).” For many years he worked at the Natural History Museum as a Associate Researcher, as his own collection came to the museum on permanent loan with the palaeontological collection of the University of Bern.\nJörn was an incomparable colleague and friend, a unique arrangement of rigour and gentleness, endlessly calm, humble, and naturally curious. He took real pleasure in travelling, field working, meeting people, and trying to communicate with them. As he could fluently speak French (he could correct my mistakes), English, Spanish, and Russian in addition to his German mother tongue, this was an opportunity to create bridges between people during congresses and he was always interested in the people behind the projects.\nJörn Geister had undertaken the writing of a comprehensive book about his family’s history, which he was unable to complete before passing away on January 18th at the age of 84, after several years of battling illness. He was married to Marion, a hydrogeologist from Luxembourg, and together they had four children. Today, six grandchildren mourn the loss of their grandfather."

    "text": "The roots of the society reach into the late 1960s. At that time, the country with the largest number of researchers in the field of fossil coelenterates was the Soviet Union. It might be unbelievable today, but the Second All Union Symposium on Fossil Corals of the USSR organized 1967 in Tallinn (now Estonia) was attended by 127 researchers, and only two of them were from a foreign country. During this meeting the decision was made to open the next meeting in 1971 to the international public.\nHence, the First International Paleontological Symposium on the Study of Fossil Corals was organized on August 18th to 25th, 1971 in Novosibirsk, Russia. Thanks to the talents and networking of the Academician Boris Sergeevich Sokolov, and despite the political differences between the East and West, many coral researchers from Western countries could attend the meeting in Novosibirsk. According to several sources, most or all Western attendees met in a hall of Moscow Airport. From there they all took the same flight to Novosibirsk. We do not want to imagine the future of coral research and our society if anything had gone wrong on that flight.\nThe meeting in Novosibirsk was very successful and set the pace for the future international collaboration in fossil coral research. The society was still not formally set up, but things were set in motion, when the International Committee on Fossil Corals was created. If you look at the composition of the committee, it reads like the who is who of coral research. We find among the founding fathers and mothers D. Hill, J.-P. Chevalier, M. Minato, W. Oliver and B.S. Sokolov in the rank of president and vice-presidents.\nIn Novosibirsk started also a very important tradition for the society’s symposia: the society bell (see photo). The bell will ring twice during a symposium; at the opening ceremony to mark the start and during the closing ceremony to mark the end of the symposium. The name and year of the symposium is engraved on the bell, and it is one important task of the last symposium organizer to ship the bell to the next symposiums location.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe society bell at the Liège symposium in 2011. In the back Eddy Poty, a future Milne Edwards Medalist (2015).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA very difficult task in Novosibirsk was to find a volunteer to organize the next international symposium in 1975. It was finally J.-P. Chevalier who accepted the task to organize it in Paris. This choice seemed to be somewhat natural, since the “Paris School of Coral Research” was at that time the second largest national group of coral researchers. Some present at the banquet, where J.-P. Chevalier accepted the task, will also talk about a very festive atmosphere, so typical for meetings of the fossil coral researchers, which helped to reduce the concerns of the future symposium organizer.\nIn Novosibirsk, it was also agreed to regularly publish (at least one volume per year) a Newsletter entitled Fossil Cnidaria to foster the information exchange between the different national communities. Again, it was J.-P. Chevalier, who took over the task and became the first editor of the newsletter.\nIt is not always easy to trace the history of the society, and this does not concern only the early days. A lot of the society business, including the distribution of the newsletter and collecting membership fees (corresponding to the costs for printing and sending the newsletter), was done in a private and sometimes unorthodox way. It was often done to avoid spending money (which the association never had). There are several rumors that some of the institutions who significantly contributed to the success of the society, were actually never aware of doing it. The strong personal links and engagements of society members also helped to fly under the radar during the politically difficult times and to continue the exchange between the scientific communities of the different countries and political systems.\nThe Second International Symposium on Fossil Corals and Coral Reefs was held in September 1975 in Paris. Apart from the scientific success, the Paris meeting is important for the decision to make things more formal. Hence, J.-P. Chevalier took the initiative for writing a constitution, which was adopted and published in Fossil Cnidaria in 1976. Thus, the International Association for the Study of Fossil Cnidaria was established. It was also decided that the Chair of the last symposium becomes the president of the association/society for the next 4 years. Hence, again we see J.-P. Chevalier at the forefront of the society business and responsibilities.\nYou would say that in Paris everything was fine, but this meeting also reminded us that politics can become dominant, and colleagues from several countries were not allowed to attend the symposium. If you talk to different colleagues present in Paris, one may wonder if the conference banquet was organized in a splendid Castle outside of Paris or just a fine restaurant in the city center of Paris. But independent from the location, you will hear stories about splendid food and good French vines. Important for the society was also a change in the editorial team of the newsletter, which was for the next 4 years edited by Bill Oliver (Washington) and Jim Sorauf (Binghamton). They established a very effective system in putting to work the entire coral community. The workload was shared by numerous national correspondences collecting all kinds of news and information in their countries, and colleagues who collected the bibliographic information for specific taxonomic groups or topics (called bibliographers).\nIf you look on the titles of the following symposia, you will see that it was always about more than fossil corals, and names as Fossil Cnidarians (Warsaw, 1979) or Fossil Cnidaria and Archaeocyathids and Stromatoporiods (Washington, 1983) have been used. The organization of the Warsaw symposium was successfully headed by Ewa Roniewicz and the choice of Warsaw clearly shows the principal idea behind the society – enable scientific exchanges beyond political boundaries and try to bring people together. Hence in those times, the alternation between symposia in eastern and western countries was the best compromise to ensure that members of different national communities could meet, and it helped to circulate news, reprints and fossil material also to those unable to participate. After the Warsaw symposium Jerzy Fedorowski became president, and John Jell (Brisbane) took over the responsibility of newsletter editor for the following four years. The Washington symposium, organized by the coral group of the Smithsonian Museums headed by Bill Oliver, is so far the only symposium organized on the North American continent. After this symposium Klemens Oekentorp (Münster) became the editor of the newsletter.\nThe fifth symposium was organized not in 1987, but in 1988 for the first and only time in the southern hemisphere in Brisbane (Australia). The date was very convenient since it not only corresponded to the bi-centennial anniversary for Australia, but also offered the possibility to attend the IASFCP symposium and the ICRS congress. It was at this symposium that the name of the society was changed to International Association for Study of fossil Cnidaria and Porifera.\nDue to changes in the British university system in the late 1980’s, the initial plan to organize the 1991 symposium in Newcastle-upon-Thyme as proposed by Colin Scrutton had to be cancelled. However, a German team led by Klemens Oekentorp stepped in. This can be seen as a lucky coincidence in the then changing political landscape. The 1991 symposium in Münster became not only the largest one (&gt;350 participants), but also one where many colleagues met for the first time after travel restrictions did not (almost) exist anymore.\nThe 7th symposium in 1995 was organized by Sergio Rodriguez in Madrid. You will hear stories about a colleague giving a talk in almost every session, or discussions with the police about throwing small stones when being bored during a fieldtrip. After this symposium the editorship of the newsletter changed after 12 years from Klemens Oekentrop to Bernard Hubmann (Graz). The 8th symposium in 1999 was organized for the first and only time in Asia by Kenji Mori in Sendai. Important for the society was the decision to use as official medium for communication the society’s website and not the printed newsletter anymore. However, the printed newsletter was maintained and Klemens Oekentrop returned as its editor with the support of Stefan Schröder (Köln). The 9th symposium was organized in Graz by Bernard Hubmann. It took place in the middle of the 2003 European heat wave, which in many places recorded the then hottest summer for the last 450 years. However, this did not slow down the participants and many even heated scientific discussions took place. After this symposium, the editorship of the newsletter and the management of the website went to Xiangdong Wang (Nanjing) and Tomas Wrozolek (Katowice).\nFor the 10th symposium in 2007 the symposium returned to the country where the first symposium took place. This time, the organization in Saint Petersburg (Russia) was in the capable hands of Olga Kossovaya. B.S. Sokolov, well in his 90’s at this time, but still interested and active in coral research, send greetings from his Moscow home. After this symposium Tomas Wrozolek was in charge of the website and the newsletter.\nA team around Eddy Poty organized the 11th symposium in Liège in 2011. Participants will remember the charm of the meeting location in the old buildings of the Medicine Faculty. Since this symposium, the society awards at the closing ceremony of each symposium the Milne Edwards Medal. It rewards a scientist for his/her significant contributions to the understanding of fossil corals, sponges and reefs by means of a substantial body of research. The first medalists were Francoise Debrenne (Paris) and John Jell (Brisbane).\nThe 12th symposium was organized in 2015 in Oman (Muscat) by Michaela Bernecker. It was the smallest symposium in number of attendees, but the participants were able to see the fascinating geology and palaeontology of the SE Arabic Peninsula. At Muscat, Eddy Poty (Liège) was recipient of the Milne Edwards Medal. Discussions how to modernize the association had already started in Liège, and were continuing after the Muscat symposium. First steps were made, but were interrupted in 2017 by the sudden death of the society’s president Michaela Bernecker. The interim was assured by Francesca Bosellini who had agreed to organize the 13th symposium.\nIn 2019 the symposium returned to Europe and was organized in Modena. Here, the members revised the constitution of the society. Among important organizational changes, the most remarkable change is that the name was changed to International Fossil Coral and Reef Society. The Milne Edwards Medal was awarded to Ann Budd (Iowa City).\nA lot of housekeeping has been done in the last years, and we are delighted that with the contribution of many people, new initiatives have been brought to light. Since the future of our science and the society relies on young people, they start to play a more and more active and prominent role, not only in the society’s life, but also in the council.\nOver the many years, the symposia have all demonstrated the diversity and dynamics of research related to fossil corals, sponges and reefs in the broadest sense. Even if shrinking, our scientific community remains as lively, diverse and friendly as it has been from the beginning. If you speak to society members, almost all will tell you about strong scientific links and collaborations, which started with their first participation at one of the symposia. But most important for them will be to tell you about the great friendships, which resulted from the meetings. If some members would have been more turned into making money, they could have run a successful business for renting out holiday accommodations or rental cars for holidays and field work.\nThe success of the society has always been thanks to its members and many people have served in official positions. They are thanked for their time and energy devoted to the society business, but more important are all the almost invisible and unknown people behind the scene who helped IASFCP and IFCRS over the last decades.\nAcknowledgement\nIt would have been impossible to write this text without the many information, memories, stories and documents shared by different members with me over the last 2 decades – may it be after a more formal request, or stories told with a glass of beer or wine in the speakers’ hand. It would not be fair to try to provide names of all the sources here, since this list would undoubtedly be more incomplete than complete. I just want to thank everybody who in one way or another contributed to this text.",

    "text": "Jörn GEISTER (Fig. 1) was born on October 29, 1940, in Würbenthal, in the Eastern Sudetes, amidst the turmoil of World War II. The territory, now part of the Czech Republic, had been annexed by the Third Reich two years before his birth. In 1946, he was forced to migrate to Germany with his mother and grandparents. His father had already perished in Berlin with the arrival of the Russian Red Army. He vividly remembered the long journey in a windowless cattle train. After several relocations within Germany—Bavaria, Westphalia, and the Black Forest—where he attended primary school, his family finally settled in Württemberg. In 1960, he completed his Abitur at Wagenburg-Gymnasium in Stuttgart, specializing in mathematics and natural sciences. From 1960 to 1967, he studied geology and paleontology at the University of Stuttgart. During his studies, he spent eight months conducting fieldwork on Jurassic stratigraphy in Spain (Province of Valencia).\nHis studies were crowned by a Diplomarbeit guided by O. F. Geyer, devoted to the Jurassic stratigraphy of the region of Tabernes de Valldigna (Spain, Valencia Province).\n\n\n\nFig. 1: Jörn Geister in Bern 2019\n\n\nFrom 1968 to 1970, he obtained financial support for a research stage from the Biology department of the University of Cartagena (Colombia) and then from the Instituto Colombo-Alemán de Investigaciones Cientificas Santa Marta (Colombia) to put a first foot in the ecology of Recent reefs and the systematics of the West Indian coral fauna. This work was crowned in August 1973 by a doctoral thesis defended in Stuttgart, guided by O.F. Geyer, and entitled: “Riffbau und geologische Entwicklungsgeschichte der Insel San Andres (westliches Karibisches Meer, Kolumbien)” [Reef construction and geological development history of the island of San Andres (western Caribbean Sea, Colombia)].\nThe Colombian islands of San Andres and Providencia will stay in his heart forever. Then he obtained a position at the Geological Institute of the University in Bern in which he will get the status of Assistent, then Oberassistent, Oberassistent-Lektor, and Privatdozent. For many years numerous students were trained by him in macropalaeontology, in lectures and practical courses. From 1974 to 1980 he followed his research on Quaternary Caribbean reefs (Fig. 2) and defended a habilitation in Bern to obtain the Venia Docendi in 1982.\n\n\n\nFig. 2: The famous Geister’s zonation of Caribbean reefs in its english version (Geister 2011, Jörn published many versions of this model in various languages).\n\n\nSoon after his habilitation, he organised with René Herb a course in French Géologie et paléoécologie des récifs for the universities of western Switzerland, which is a nice summary of the topic at that time. Since 1992, he had to teach alone micropalaeontology, stratigraphy and historical geology in Bern. But his position was also an opportunity to guide field excursions—he loved that—in Recent and Pleistocene reefs of the Red Sea (Sinai Peninsula) and organize seminars on Holocene and Pleistocene reefs, on sclerochronology, actuopalaeontology, or applied ecology of Recent reefs (among others).\nIn March 1986 he organized the Symposium “Meeresforschung in der Schweiz [Marine research in Switzerland]” in Bern, with more than 200 participants.\nHe also took responsibility for various “Diplomarbeiten” on palaeontology in the Jura mountains, Recent reefs or sclerochronology but also the guidance of PhD theses in the frame of a project on Mauritius Island. Thomas Wagner (1994) defended a thesis on: Grundlagen der Sklerochronologie von Riffkorallen und ihre Eignung zur Erfassung von Umwelteinflüssen im Riffökosystem von Mauritius (Indischer Ozean) [Basics of sclerochronology of reef corals and their suitability for recording environmental influences in the reef ecosystem of Mauritius (Indian Ocean)] and Ina Immenhauser-Potthast, (1994) on: Geochemie von rezenten, massigen Korallen und umweltgeologische Untersuchungen im Riffökosystem der Insel Mauritius (Indischer Ozean). [Geochemistry of Recent, massive corals and environmental geological studies in the reef ecosystem of Mauritius Island (Indian Ocean)].\nI met Jörn for the first time in 1989 in the Quarry of Malancourt-la-Montagne in Lorraine. We were surrounded by Bajocian reefs and he proposed to collaborate and organise a field excursion on the Jurassic reefs of Lorraine for the Münster (1991) congress of the Fossil Cnidaria and Porifera Association. He already had good experience preparing such events. He had previously prepared the spring excursion of the Swiss Paleontological Society for which he was president (1987-88), it was a three-day excursion near Marseille with J Philip. He had also prepared logistically more difficult events such as the Rio Gurabo Neogene stratigraphy excursion for the 9th Caribbean Geological Conference (Sto. Domingo 1980) with P. Jung und J. Saunders and the Pleistocene Reef Terraces and Coral Environments at Sto. Domingo and near Boca Chica, southern coast of the Dominican Republic, for the same congress.\nThen I saw how an excursion had to be prepared. Jörn noted every detail in his notebook, the quality of the food, the price of everything and even the hour of the sunset. Then our excursion happened and we decided to make it again for the pre-congress excursion of the Luxembourg Symposium that we organised together in 1994. Jörn had prepared also a wonderful post-congress snorkelling trip in the Sinai Peninsula. I remember him swimming like a fish, going down at ten meters deep so easily with a shirt and corduroy pants to protect his very white skin. After these events, we decided to build a research project on the climatic conditions of the Jurassic Oxfordian reef event. Together we recruited Bertrand Martin-Garin for a pH D thesis and this was a source of multiple collaborations and field works in France, Switzerland, Morocco, and Crimea (Fig. 3-4) that produced results for a decade beyond the date of his retirement in 2006.\n\n\n\nFig. 3: Jörn Geister in 2005 in Crimea in Simferopol.\n\n\n\n\n\nFig. 4: Jörn Geister in 2005 writing his notes in the field on an Oxfordian reef at Sudak.\n\n\n\n\n\nFig. 5: Field in Morroco in 2003. From left to right: Bertrand Martin Garin, Jörn Geister and B. Lathuilière\n\n\nAfter that date, he became a free collaborator of the Natural History Museum in Bern. In the same decade of activity, he never abandoned the work done on Recent Colombian reefs in collaboration with J.M. Diaz. His fidelity to his Colombian fieldwork allowed him to produce comparable underwater photos of the same reefal place at a 30-year distance (see his 2012 publication). Jörn has never chosen between Recent and Ancient. It was a real strength of his approach, always searching for a comparable scenario in Recent to explain observations of the past. After retiring, he continued working regularly at the Museum in Bern, where he developed a close relationship with Ursula Menkveld, Curator of paleontology, and Bernhard Hostettler, first working as a student as geoscientific preparator and later with the Master and PhD title as a scientific collaborator. Acting as an unofficial advisor, he assisted the latter in defending a Master’s thesis in 2006 on Oxfordian sea urchins (Die fossilen regulären Echiniden der Günsberg-Formation).” For many years he worked at the Natural History Museum as a Associate Researcher, as his own collection came to the museum on permanent loan with the palaeontological collection of the University of Bern.\nJörn was an incomparable colleague and friend, a unique arrangement of rigour and gentleness, endlessly calm, humble, and naturally curious. He took real pleasure in travelling, field working, meeting people, and trying to communicate with them. As he could fluently speak French (he could correct my mistakes), English, Spanish, and Russian in addition to his German mother tongue, this was an opportunity to create bridges between people during congresses and he was always interested in the people behind the projects.\nJörn Geister had undertaken the writing of a comprehensive book about his family’s history, which he was unable to complete before passing away on January 18th at the age of 84, after several years of battling illness. He was married to Marion, a hydrogeologist from Luxembourg, and together they had four children. Today, six grandchildren mourn the loss of their grandfather."
